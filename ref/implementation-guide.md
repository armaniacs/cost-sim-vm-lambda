## TDD Development Methodology

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

#### Red Phase: Write Failing Tests
```python
def test_calculate_lambda_cost_basic(self):
    """Test basic Lambda cost calculation"""
    config = LambdaConfig(
        memory_mb=512, 
        execution_time_seconds=10,
        monthly_executions=1_000_000,
        include_free_tier=True
    )
    calculator = LambdaCalculator()
    result = calculator.calculate_total_cost(config)
    
    # This test should initially fail
    assert result["total_cost"] > 0
```

#### Green Phase: Minimum Implementation
```python
class LambdaCalculator:
    def calculate_total_cost(self, config: LambdaConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Minimum implementation to pass the test
        return {"total_cost": 8.33}
```

#### Refactor Phase: Improve Implementation
```python
class LambdaCalculator:
    def calculate_total_cost(self, config: LambdaConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        request_charges = self.calculate_request_charges(config)
        compute_charges = self.calculate_compute_charges(config)
        total_cost = request_charges + compute_charges
        
        return {
            "request_charges": request_charges,
            "compute_charges": compute_charges,
            "total_cost": total_cost,
            "gb_seconds": self.calculate_gb_seconds(config),
            "configuration": dataclasses.asdict(config)
        }
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

**Target Coverage: 90%+**
- Unit tests: 100% for business logic (calculators)
- Integration tests: API endpoints and data flow
- End-to-end tests: Complete user workflows

**Current Achievement:**
- Overall coverage: 54% (API layer not covered by tests)
- Core business logic: 100% coverage
- 36 passing tests with comprehensive validation

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+ (for npm dependencies)
- mise (development tool manager)

### Setup Steps

1. **Install mise**:
   ```bash
   curl https://mise.run | sh
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mise install
   ```

3. **Run setup**:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

### Available Make Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make setup` | Complete environment setup |
| `make install` | Install dependencies only |
| `make test` / `make t` | Run tests with coverage |
| `make lint` / `make l` | Run linting checks |
| `make format` / `make f` | Format code |
| `make dev` / `make d` | Start development server |
| `make clean` / `make c` | Clean generated files |

## Code Quality Standards

### Formatting and Linting
- **Black**: Code formatting (88 character line length)
- **isort**: Import organization
- **flake8**: Style and error checking
- **mypy**: Type checking with strict mode

### Git Hooks
Pre-commit hooks enforce:
- Code formatting
- Import sorting
- Type checking
- Test execution
- Security scanning

### CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Code quality checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency updates
- Coverage reporting

## Architecture Patterns

### Application Factory Pattern
```python
def create_app(config_name: str = "default") -> Flask:
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(config[config_name])
    
    # Register blueprints
    from app.api.calculator_api import calculator_bp
    app.register_blueprint(calculator_bp, url_prefix="/api/v1/calculator")
    
    return app
```

### Blueprint Pattern
```python
# Modular API organization
calculator_bp = Blueprint("calculator", __name__)

@calculator_bp.route("/lambda", methods=["POST"])
def calculate_lambda_cost():
    # Implementation
```

### Dataclass Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class LambdaConfig:
    memory_mb: int
    execution_time_seconds: int
    monthly_executions: int
    include_free_tier: bool
```

### Repository Pattern
```python
# Separation of concerns
class LambdaCalculator:
    """Business logic for Lambda cost calculation"""
    
class CalculatorAPI:
    """API layer handling HTTP requests/responses"""
```

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization
- **Debounced Input**: Form changes trigger calculations after 500ms
- **Client-side Caching**: Results cached for repeated calculations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
- **Lazy Loading**: Chart.js loaded only when needed

### Backend Optimization
- **Pre-computed Constants**: All pricing data stored as constants
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple execution points in single API call
- **Stateless Design**: No server-side session management
- **Efficient Calculations**: Optimized algorithms for cost computation

### Database Considerations
Currently file-based (no database required):
- Pricing data: Hard-coded constants (updated manually)
- User preferences: localStorage (client-side)
- Calculation results: In-memory (not persisted)

**Future Enhancement**: Database integration for:
- Historical pricing data
- User account management
- Calculation history
- Analytics and reporting

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Type checking on all API inputs
- Range validation for numeric parameters
- Sanitization of user inputs
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### No Authentication Required
- Public API for cost calculations
- No sensitive data exposure
- Rate limiting not implemented (consider for production)

### Security Scanning
- GitHub security advisories monitoring
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Pre-commit security hooks

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Flask development server
- Hot reload for code changes
- Debug mode enabled
- Detailed error reporting

### Production Considerations
- WSGI server (Gunicorn recommended)
- Environment variable configuration
- Logging and monitoring
- Error handling and recovery
- Load balancing for scale

### Container Deployment
Dockerfile example:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY app/ app/
EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app.main:create_app()"]
```
